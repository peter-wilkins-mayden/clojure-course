# Clojure Course

This course is inspired by and borrows from the excellent [Clojure Mooc](http://iloveponies.github.io/120-hour-epic-sax-marathon/index.html) by the by the CS department of University of Helsinki.

Focuses on:

- use the repl for fast learning feedback.
- writing human friendly code from the start
- avoiding clojure's pain points 
- uses familiar problem domains

Setup
- Join [Clojurians on Slack.](http://clojurians.net/) (most important step - google then ask on beginners if you get stuck at any point) 
- Get [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- get the repo:
 ```git clone https://github.com/peter-wilkins/clojure-course.git```

- Get  [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

Editors - the instructions in the chapters assume cursive but if you prefer another and know how to repl already use whatever you want
- Get [Intellij Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- Get [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/)

Shortcuts - Learn or change 2 shortcuts in Intellij for REPL happiness
- Load File in REPL
